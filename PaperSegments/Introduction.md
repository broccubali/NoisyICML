## The Growing Complexity of Solving Partial Differential Equations
Partial differential equations (PDEs) are central to the modeling and analysis of intricate physical systems across a wide range of disciplines like fluid dynamics, electromagnetism, and wave propagation. Traditional numerical solvers like finite difference and finite element methods have been used to numerically approximate PDE solutions. Although these solvers work well in ideal situations, they tend to fail when noise is present. Real-world situations- marked by measurement errors, environmental variability, and computational imprecision- pose challenges that traditional solvers are not well-suited to address.
Machine learning, specifically Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), has also been shown to be a very promising alternative for solving PDEs. PINNs incorporate the governing equations into their loss functions, and they are capable of approximating solutions even with sparse data and in complicated geometries. PINNs have very serious drawbacks when there is noise in the data or in boundary conditions. Experiments showed that noisy inputs result in poor convergence, incorrect solutions, and a loss of the network's capacity to generalize.

## Case Studies: Burgers' and Helmholtz Equations
To explore and address the challenges of solving noisy PDEs, we focus on two representative equations: the Burgers’ equation and the Helmholtz equation.
### 1. Burgers' Equation
Burgers’ equation is a nonlinear PDE commonly used to model shock waves, turbulence, and other nonlinear wave phenomena. It combines advective and diffusive effects, making it a benchmark for testing numerical methods and machine learning models. The equation is expressed as:
< insert the equation >
< explain the terms > 
The nonlinearity and the coupling of advection and diffusion terms make Burgers’ equation particularly sensitive to noise in initial or boundary conditions.

### 2. Helmholtz Equation
The Helmholtz equation is pivotal in wave propagation, acoustics, and electromagnetics, modeling the behavior of time-harmonic waves. Its general form is:
< insert the equation > 
< explain the terms > 
The equation's sensitivity to high-frequency noise and complex boundary conditions poses significant challenges for traditional solvers and machine learning approaches alike.

## Addressing the Limitations of PINNs with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
PINNs, despite their potential, struggle with noisy data, often converging to erroneous solutions. To overcome this, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with PINNs. KANs, inspired by Kolmogorov’s Superposition Theorem, excel in approximating high-dimensional functions by decomposing them into simpler, one-dimensional mappings. This property makes KANs particularly effective for denoising the outputs of PINNs.
In our approach, PINNs are used to approximate the solution of the governing PDE, while KANs preprocess the noisy inputs to recover high-fidelity solutions. This synergy allows us to address the inherent noise sensitivity of PINNs, enabling robust and accurate predictions even under challenging conditions.

## Broader Implications
Our work contributes the following:
1.	It systematically evaluates the limitations of PINNs in handling noisy PDEs, particularly for Burgers’ and Helmholtz equations <and maybe more but we'll leave this here>
2.	It introduces a hybrid PINN-KAN framework, demonstrating its robustness across different noise distributions and PDEs.
3.	It expands the applicability of machine learning-based PDE solvers to real-world scenarios, where noise is unavoidable.
In addition, we present alternative views, including improving PINN and KAN architectures to encourage healthy debate in the community.
By overcoming these challenges, this paper aims to close the gap between theoretical model and practical usage, promoting scientific computation. The proposed hybrid PINN-KAN methodology not only suggests a way toward handling noisy PDEs but also points toward the general trend of combining physics-based concepts and machine learning achievements. This trend may unlock new opportunities in varied applications, such as environmental models or biomedical engineering, where data-based solutions have to deal with noisy, missing, or inaccurate observations.

Our work underscores the importance of cross-disciplinary collaboration between applied mathematics, physics, and machine learning to develop resilient computational tools. By demonstrating the robustness and scalability of the proposed framework through case studies like Burgers’ and Helmholtz equations, this paper invites the community to reimagine the role of machine learning in tackling the complexities of real-world systems governed by PDEs.
From this perspective, we seek to encourage a new generation of approaches that accept the flaws of real-world data while upholding the rigor and precision necessary for significant scientific and engineering progress.
