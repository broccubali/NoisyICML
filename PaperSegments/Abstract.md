## Abstract
This position paper argues that the current challenges of dealing with noisy data in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) demand an immense shift in the paradigms used in machine learning toward handling noisy partial differential equations. We propose an integrated framework which includes Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to handle this challenge. Despite their ability to naturally include physics into their learning paradigm, their performance drops precipitously in a noisy environment. We recover the structure of noisy Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) at high fidelity by using KANs for denoising the outputs of PINNs. We demonstrate in this paper the improvement in terms of robustness, scalability, and accuracy brought about by the approach using the Burgers equation, Helmholtz equation, and several other similar benchmarks. Alternative views, such as reliance on sophisticated PINN architectures and traditional numerical solvers, are critically explored to spark fruitful dialogue. This study points toward the importance of noise-aware and physics-informed approaches in broadening the relevance of machine learning within the domain of scientific computation.
